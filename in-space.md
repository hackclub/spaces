### Hi! Welcome to your VS-Code Space!

You can use this just like you would vs-code on your own computer! For security reasons, we can not give you root access to the container, but we have preinstalled a number of development tools for you!

#### Pre-installed tools:
If a tool you need is not listed, attempt to install it using one of the package managers listed, and if that is not possible, ask in #spaces on slack and I can probably add the tool!

If a tool listed here is not working, wait a few minutes and try again! The installation is ran in the background upon space creation to minimize space creation times, so you might have to wait a minute or two for all tools to become available

##### Hackatime

Make sure to set your hackatime api key in settings! if you have done that, Hackatime has been auto installed and set up for you, and will be tracking your time
